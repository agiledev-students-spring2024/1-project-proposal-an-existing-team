# Team Dynamics

### What and why?

**Team Dynamics** would aim to improve team collaboration and productivity via psychometric testing. 

With tests like the Strong Interest Inventory, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Cultural Intelligence Assessment, Holland Code Assessment, and the OCEAN Assessment, teams will be able to improve collaboration and self-organization. 

### For whom?

Agile practitioners, HR managers, project leaders, professors, consultants, and those who want to evaluate and improve team dynamics and work processes.   

### How?

The system would provide users with an interface for taking psychometric tests, manually entering existing results, and accessing in-depth analysis of the results and resources on team building. 

### Scope

This project would probably be a balanced mix of difficulty and achievability. The team would develop a user friendly interface, storing and organizing data across teams, while preserving the validity and reliability of our findings via e.g., not a Buzzfeed quiz.
